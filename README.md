# PythonCalculator
Python version of several self-educational projects wherein I make a calculator.

Basically I want to figure out basics of several languages by creating a basic calculator with a GUI.

I'm starting out with Python since it's my most familiar language.
I'll most probably do a C# and Java one next, then who knows?
This isn't anything groundbreaking or even notable, really.
It really will be just a run-of-the-mill calculator. Probably.
